# Python-Projects
All Python related stuff

This repository is for all the scripts I write in Python, not counting the first scripts I copied from websites used to teach myself
Python.  As with my hello-world git, this repository is only for backing up the files I write.  I hope that I will fill up this git with loads of scripts I write myself and in collaboration with other software engineering students.  Python is a good scripting language to learn, and I hope to learn everything about it in the years to come.  This may be a good repository to upload everything I write for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory internships I applied to, provided I get in.  I will let whomever I work with at the laboratory access this git, and make pull requests if need be.  I will also let anyone else I collaborate with on a Python project in the future make pull requests.
